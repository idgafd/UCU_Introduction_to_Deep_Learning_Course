Structure:

* Assignment_1 — Forward propagation for a small CNN (CifarTanhNet): build the model in PyTorch, trace tensor shapes, visualize the computational graph, derive the full forward pass in scalar equations, and re-implement the forward pass in NumPy for correctness + speed comparison.  
* Assignment_2 — Training + convolution efficiency: implement a train/test loop in PyTorch (SGD with momentum, MSE loss, accuracy metric, accuracy-vs-updates curve), implement Conv2D via im2col (matrix multiplication), and write the im2col forward equations.
